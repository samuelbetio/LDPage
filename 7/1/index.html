        <h1>Like Tears in Rain</h1>
        <blockquote>Where am I going? How long have I got?</blockquote>
        <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter
            in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to
            die.</p>
        <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just
            his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...</p>
